# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
**A machine learning project with deployment** 

This machine learning project aims to predict diabetes presence based on attributes like Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, and Age. Using a dataset with this information, the project involves preprocessing steps, selecting and training classification algorithms, evaluating model performance, tuning hyperparameters, and validating the final model for deployment. Successful implementation could provide a valuable tool for early diabetes detection and intervention.

*Usage:*
firstly install libs,
```bash
pip install flask
pip install flask_cors
pip install statsmodels
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
```
and other basic machine learning libs

*RUN:*
```bash
python app.py
```
or
```bash
python3 app.py
```
